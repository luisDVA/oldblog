Welcome to my research page.

I'll be using this site as a blog for research-related topics. This site is a work in progress as I slowly learn more about Jekyll, Markdown and Git.


### Research

I'm interested in understanding the processes that shaped mammal diversity, and the factors that currently threaten terrestrial mammals.

For my PhD (University of Queensland, Australia; 2010-2014) I studied the relationship between the evolutionary history of terrestrial mammals and their current risk of extinction. I'm currently investigating the relationships between phylogenetic relatedness, morphological similarity, and ecological strategies in rodents.

_Key words:_

- Phylogenetic comparative methods
- Diversification rate analyses
- Ecomorphology
- Museum collections
